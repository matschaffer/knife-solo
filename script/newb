=== Thanks for helping with Knife-Solo! ===

The b folder contains bundler bin-stubs. These will let you test your changes more easily.

Just run:  $(cd `dirname $0`/.. && pwd )/b/knife

Use rake to run the tests and rake -T to see the options.

If you want to run integration testing grab your AWS keys from https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials and enter them in test/support/config.yml

The integration tests will try to create a key pair called knife-solo. If you've already created a key pair with that name please store it in test/support/knife-solo.pem. If you need to use a different key name you can set it in test/support/config.yml
