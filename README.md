## Description

knife-solo adds a handful of Knife commands that aim to make working with chef-solo as powerful as chef-server.

    gem install knife-solo

Or add this to your Gemfile if you use bundler:

    gem 'knife-solo'

Having the gem installed will add Knife subcommands. Run `knife solo` with no arguments to see a list of available commands.
